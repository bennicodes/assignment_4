I chose these components because I feel like almost all of them are used in every functional website you can find and therefore highly relevant to becoming a good developer.

## Usage

Open the index.html file in your browser.
Follow instructions on screen and press the menu button to select which component youÂ´d like to see.

## Features

Select a component and see how the component looks in different states, and try them out yourself.

I used this video as inspiration for some styling, transitions when creating the tooltip component. The person in the video only used css. So i made the functionality of the tooltip component in javascript to shorten the code length.

The accordion-, tabs-, and search filter component are from a workshop which we did in class.
